To the kernel, all open files are referred to by file descriptors. A file descriptor is a
non-negative integer. When we open an existing file or create a new file, the kernel
returns a file descriptor to the process. When we want to read or write a file, we
identify the file with the file descriptor that was returned by open or creat as an
argument to either read or write
]


[
By convention, UNIX System shells associate file descriptor 0 with the standard
input of a process, file descriptor 1 with the standard output, and file descriptor 2 with
the standard error. This convention is used by the shells and many applications; it is
not a feature of the UNIX kernel. Nevertheless, many applications would break if these
associations weren’t followed.
Although their values are standardized by POSIX.1, the magic numbers 0, 1, and 2
should be replaced in POSIX-compliant applications with the symbolic constants
STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, and STDERR_FILENO to improve readability.
These constants are defined in the <unistd.h> header.
File descriptors range from 0 through OPEN_MAX−1.

the file descriptor returned by open and openat is guaranteed to be the lowest-
numbered unused decriptor

The basic idea behind TOCTTOU errors is that a program is vulnerable if it makes
two file-based function calls where the second call depends on the results of the first
call. Because the two calls are not atomic, the file can change between the two calls,
thereby invalidating the results of the first call, leading to a program error. TOCTTOU
errors in the file system namespace generally deal with attempts to subvert file system
permissions by tricking a privileged program into either reducing permissions on a
privileged file or modifying a privileged file to open up a security hole. Wei and Pu
discuss TOCTTOU weakbess in the UNIX file system interface

[
When a process terminates, all of its open files are closed automatically by the 
kernel. Many programs take advantage of this fact and don't explicitly close open files.

Every open file has an associated ‘‘current file offset,’’ normally a non-negative integer
that measures the number of bytes from the beginning of the file. (We describe some
exceptions to the ‘‘non-negative’’ qualifier later in this section.) Read and write
operations normally start at the current file offset and cause the offset to be incremented
by the number of bytes read or written. By default, this offset is initialized to 0 when a
file is opened, unless the O_APPEND option is specified.
off_t lseek(int df, off_t offset, int whence);
	whence:
		- SEEK_SET: file's offset -> offset bytes from the beginning of the file
		- SEEK_CUR: file's offset -> current value + offset
		- SEEK_END: file's offset -> sizeof file + offset 
	example:
		off_t	currentposition;
		currentposition = lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR);
		^
		|
	this technique can also be used do determine if a file is capable of seeking.
	If the file desc refers to a pipe, FIFO, or socket, lseek sets errno to ESPIPE 
	and return -1.	
	Normally, a file’s current offset must be a non-negative integer. It is possible,
	however, that certain devices could allow negative offsets. But for regular files, the
	offset must be non-negative. Because negative offsets are possible, we should be careful
	to compare the return value from lseek as being equal to or not equal to −1, rather
	than testing whether it is less than 0.
	lseek only records the current file offset within the kernel - it does not cause any
	I/O to take place. This offset is then used by the next read or write operation.
	The file's offset can be greater than the file's current size, in which case the next 
	write to the file will extend the file. This is reffered to as creating a hole in a file 
	and is allowed (a hole is zeros)

Beware when trying to measure the performance of programs that read and write files. The
operating system will try to cache the file incore, so if you measure the performance of the
program repeatedly, the successive timings will likely be better than the first. This
improvement occurs because the first run causes the file to be entered into the system’s cache,
and successive runs access the file from the system’s cache instead of from the disk. (The term
incore means in main memory. Back in the day, a computer ’s main memory was built out of
ferrite core. This is where the phrase ‘‘core dump’’ comes from: the main memory image of a
program stored in a file on disk for diagnosis.)
In the tests reported in Figure 3.6, each run with a different buffer size was made using a
different copy of the file so that the current run didn’t find the data in the cache from the
previous run. The files are large enough that they all don’t remain in the cache (the test system
was configured with 6 GB of RAM).

[
after each write is complete, the current file offset in the file table entry is
incremented by the number of bytes written. if this causes the current file offset
to exceed the current file size, the current file size in the i-node table entry is set
to the current file offset
append: offset is set to the sizeof file, each write will then be appended to the current
end of file
the lseek function modifies only the current file offset in the file table entry
no i/o takse place.

traditional implementations of the UNIX system have a buffer cache or page 
cache in the kernel through which most disk i/o passes. when we write data
to a file, the data is normally copied by the kernel into one of its buffers
and queued for writing to disk at some later time. this is called delayed write
int	sync(void);
 -simply queues all the modified block buffers for writing and returns
 -it does not wait for the disk writes to take place
 -this function is normally called periodically (usually every 30 seconds)
  from a system daemon, often called update. this guarantees regular flushing
  of the kernel's block buffers. the command sync(1) also calls the sync function.
int	fsync(int fd);
 -refers only to a single file, specified by fd
 -waits for the disk writes to complete before returning
 -this function is used when an application, such as a database, needs to be
  sure that the modified blocks have been written to the disk.
int	fdatasync(int fd);
 -similar to fsync, but it affects only the data portions of a file
 -NOTE: freebsd 8.0 does not support fdatasync
